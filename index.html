Its purpose was to showcase the highs and lows of investing in BitCoin throughout its lifespan.</br><br/>Although the name "FOMO" was chosen due to the culture surrounding cryptocurrency investors, the real purpose of the app was to show people they should err on the side of caution when investing in Bitcoin</br><br/>The Interface was also built to try and be as dynamic as possible - allowing the user to click or type away.</br><br/>This app currently uses the Coindesk API. While no backend will be built in the future, upgrades to the user Interface may take place.</p>

Basic regex is used to filter out some URLs bad URLs, but eventually more complex methods will be utilized to make the site more functional (such as DNS queries, whosis look ups).<br/></br></p>

With family all over the world, traveling was often seen as a chore in my younger years, and not as a privilege. This man changed my perspective on that, and I wanted a way for other people to share their stories with me.</br></br></p>
